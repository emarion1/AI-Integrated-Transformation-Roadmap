# AI-Integrated Transformation Roadmap

A comprehensive framework for integrating AI into agile team topologies and organizational transformation while preserving human-centric Agile values.

## Overview

This repository provides a systematic approach to evolving Agile practices and team structures to effectively leverage AI capabilities while maintaining the core principles of the Agile Manifesto. It's designed for organizations looking to transform their software development practices through intelligent human-AI collaboration.

## Core Philosophy

Our approach is built on the principle that **AI should enhance human collaboration and decision-making, not replace it**. We focus on evolving the Agile Manifesto with AI enhancement:

- **AI-Augmented Individuals and Interactions** over AI-driven processes and tools
- **AI-Accelerated Working Software** over AI-generated comprehensive documentation
- **AI-Amplified Customer Collaboration** over AI-mediated contract negotiation
- **AI-Powered Responding to Change** over AI-optimized following a plan

üìñ See our complete [AI-Agile Manifesto Evolution](docs/overview/ai-agile-manifesto-evolution.md) for detailed comparison and implementation guidance.
