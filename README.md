# Agile Practitioner Evolution with Agentic AI

A comprehensive framework for transforming Agile Practitioner roles when agentic AI manages the complete work definition pipeline from feature requests to team-level work items.

## Overview

This repository provides guidance for a 3-person Agile cadre working in an environment where agentic AI automatically generates epics, stories, tasks, and acceptance criteria through Atlassian Cloud integration. It addresses how practitioners must evolve from work creators to work validators and AI-human collaboration orchestrators.

## The Agentic AI Reality

**What Changes**: Agentic AI now handles:
- Automatic generation of epics and user stories from feature requests
- Task breakdown and acceptance criteria creation
- Work item lifecycle management in Atlassian Cloud
- Basic dependency detection and workflow automation

**What Remains Human**:
- Strategic business alignment and priority validation
- Customer empathy and human context preservation
- Team health, motivation, and psychological safety
- Quality validation and enhancement of AI-generated work
