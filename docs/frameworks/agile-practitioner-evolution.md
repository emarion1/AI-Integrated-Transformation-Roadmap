# Agile Practitioner Role Evolution with Agentic AI

## Overview

This framework outlines how Agile Practitioner roles must evolve when agentic AI manages the complete work definition pipeline - from feature requests to team-level work items - integrated with Atlassian Cloud. It specifically addresses a 3-person Agile cadre structure with one organizational-focused and two team-focused practitioners.

## Fundamental Value and Duty Shifts with Agentic AI

- **Traditional**: Agilists facilitate work breakdown, story writing, and backlog management
- **Agentic AI Reality**: AI automatically generates epics, stories, tasks, and acceptance criteria from feature requests
- **New Focus**: Validate AI-generated work for human context, customer empathy, and business alignment
- **Key Change**: Shift from content creation to content validation and human value preservation

### From Process Facilitation to AI-Human Collaboration Orchestration
- **Traditional**: Run ceremonies, manage workflows, remove impediments
- **Agentic AI Reality**: AI manages work item lifecycle, dependencies, and basic workflow automation
- **New Focus**: Orchestrate seamless handoffs between AI automation and human decision-making
- **Key Change**: Become conductors of AI-human symphony rather than process managers

### From Reactive Problem-Solving to Proactive Pattern Recognition
- **Traditional**: Respond to team dysfunction and delivery issues as they arise
- **Agentic AI Reality**: AI provides predictive insights and early warning signals
- **New Focus**: Use AI insights to predict and prevent issues before they impact teams
- **Key Change**: Transform from firefighters to fire prevention architects
