# Agile Practitioner Role Evolution with AI Integration

## Overview

This framework outlines how Agile Practitioner roles must evolve as AI becomes integrated into software development workflows, especially with agentic AI managing work definition from feature requests to team-level issues.

## Core Value Shifts

### From Process Facilitation to AI-Human Collaboration Orchestration
- **Traditional**: Facilitating human ceremonies and removing impediments
- **AI-Enhanced**: Orchestrating seamless human-AI workflows where agentic AI manages work definition while practitioners ensure human values remain central
- **Key Change**: Practitioners become "Human-Centric AI Integrators"

### From Reactive Coaching to Proactive System Design
- **Traditional**: Responding to team dysfunctions and blockers
- **AI-Enhanced**: Designing AI-human collaboration patterns that prevent dysfunction and optimize flow
- **Key Change**: Shift from "fixing problems" to "designing intelligent systems"

### From Individual Team Optimization to Value Stream Intelligence
- **Traditional**: Optimizing single team performance metrics
- **AI-Enhanced**: Leveraging AI to optimize entire value streams from customer request to delivered value
- **Key Change**: Practitioners become "Value Stream AI Architects"
