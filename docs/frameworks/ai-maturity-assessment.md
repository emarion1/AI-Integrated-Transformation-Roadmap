# AI Maturity Assessment for Agile Practitioners

## Overview

This framework assesses how Agile practitioners progress through three levels of AI integration maturity, from basic efficiency tools to transformative organizational systems.

## Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Capable (AI as Assistant)
**Mindset**: AI saves me time

**Characteristics**:
- Uses AI for basic efficiency tasks
- Experiments with AI tools opportunistically
- Transparent about AI use to free time for human connection
- Summarizes single data sources with AI help

**Examples by Agile Ceremony**:

| Ceremony | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Backlog Refinement | Uses AI to draft acceptance criteria | "AI suggested clearer description for login feature story" |
| Sprint Planning | Drafts sprint goals and task breakdowns | "AI generated draft plan for reporting dashboard" |
| Daily Scrum | Automates notes or summaries | "AI generated concise summary for stakeholders" |
| Retrospectives | AI themes inputs or suggests questions | "AI grouped sticky notes into communication/tools categories" |

### Level 2: Adoptive (AI as Cognitive Partner)
**Mindset**: AI helps us see patterns, risks, and opportunities we may miss

**Characteristics**:
- Confidently integrates AI into complex tasks
- Designs systematic prompts and workflows
- Balances AI insights with team voice
- Integrates multiple data sources through AI

**Examples by Agile Ceremony**:

| Ceremony | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Backlog Refinement | AI identifies dependencies and inconsistencies | "AI highlighted Story A depends on Story B not in sprint" |
| Sprint Planning | AI suggests capacity-fit and what-if scenarios | "AI modeled impact of Story C on velocity and risk" |
| Daily Scrum | Detects emerging blockers and patterns | "AI highlighted multiple devs waiting on QA bottleneck" |
| Retrospectives | Synthesizes multi-sprint trends, recommends techniques | "AI surfaced recurring Dev-QA handoff friction" |

### Level 3: Transformative (AI as Scalable Coaching System)
**Mindset**: AI helps us architect proactive, scalable, systemic coaching

**Characteristics**:
- Builds AI-powered dashboards and playbooks
- Teaches others and shares knowledge systematically
- Coaches leaders on responsible AI use
- Architects proactive data flows for organizational insights

**Examples by Agile Ceremony**:

| Ceremony | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Backlog Refinement | AI monitors backlog health across teams/org | "AI flagged missing acceptance criteria across 3 teams" |
| Sprint Planning | AI recommends goals aligned with OKRs cross-team | "AI proposed sprint plan across 3 teams for release date" |
| Daily Scrum | Dashboards track blockers, escalate early | "AI notified SMs when dependencies risked PI objective" |
| Retrospectives | Facilitates distributed retros, org-wide insights | "AI compiled 15 team retros, highlighted sizing inconsistencies" |

## Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Personal Mastery & AI Fluency
- **Capable**: Basic prompt use, efficiency experiments
- **Adoptive**: Systematic prompts, complex task integration
- **Transformative**: Dashboard building, teaching others

### 2. Coaching Mindset & Engagement
- **Capable**: Transparent AI use, frees time for human connection
- **Adoptive**: Balances AI insights with team voice, guides ethical use
- **Transformative**: Coaches leaders on AI, embeds in org values

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
- **Capable**: Summarizes single data sources
- **Adoptive**: Integrates multiple sources, surfaces patterns
- **Transformative**: Architects proactive data flows org-wide

### 4. Collaboration & Influence
- **Capable**: Uses AI for communication clarity
- **Adoptive**: Brings AI into workshops and alignment
- **Transformative**: Shapes org practices, scales across portfolios

### 5. Innovation & Continuous Learning
- **Capable**: Curious, opportunistic experimenter
- **Adoptive**: Systematic experimenter, encourages peers
- **Transformative**: Pioneers approaches, builds learning ecosystems

## Self-Assessment Tool

Rate yourself (1-5) on each dimension:

**Personal Mastery & AI Fluency**
1. I experiment with AI for basic tasks
2. I use systematic prompts for complex work
3. I integrate AI insights with human judgment effectively
4. I teach others about effective AI collaboration
5. I build AI-powered systems and playbooks

**Coaching Mindset & Engagement**
1. I'm transparent about my AI use with teams
2. I balance AI insights with human perspectives
3. I guide teams on ethical AI use
4. I coach leaders on AI integration strategies
5. I embed AI thoughtfully into organizational values

**Data-Driven Decision Making**
1. I use AI to summarize information
2. I integrate multiple data sources with AI
3. I surface patterns others might miss using AI
4. I create proactive data flows for insights
5. I architect organization-wide AI analytics systems

## Progression Strategies

### Moving from Capable → Adoptive
1. **Build Awareness**: Run workshops showing AI as cognitive partner
2. **Structured Workflows**: Create shared prompt libraries for common tasks
3. **Collaboration Focus**: Use AI outputs in team workshops and discussions
4. **Critical Evaluation**: Question AI assumptions and blend with human judgment
5. **Retrospective Integration**: Use AI to synthesize themes across sprints

### Moving from Adoptive → Transformative
1. **Scale Integration**: Create enterprise dashboards across teams
2. **Embed in Processes**: Use AI for portfolio planning and scaled retrospectives
3. **Coaching Multiplier**: Train other practitioners, create reusable playbooks
4. **Systemic Mindset**: Build continuous feedback loops and early warning systems
5. **Ethical Leadership**: Establish transparency and bias awareness frameworks
