### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan

#### **Original Agile Manifesto**
> "Responding to change over following a plan"

**Focus**: Adaptability and responsiveness to changing requirements rather than rigid adherence to predetermined plans.

#### **AI-Enhanced Evolution**
> "**AI-Powered** responding to change over **AI-Optimized** following a plan"

**Enhanced Focus**: AI enables faster detection of change signals and more informed adaptation decisions while maintaining planning discipline where valuable.

**Key Changes**:
- **Early Change Detection**: AI identifies change signals before they become critical
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: AI suggests optimal responses to changing conditions
